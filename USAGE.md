usage doc is not done yet.

There is 2 way to handle actions and sdk event with this SDK:
callbacks and listeners.
use what you prefer.

Currently, you can see how to use this library using the examples:
- [Callback Example](./src/main/java/xyz/alexcrea/jacn/example/callback/TicTacToeExample1.java) (not recommended currently as it need a rewrite)
- [Listener Example](./src/main/java/xyz/alexcrea/jacn/example/callback/TicTacToeExample1.java) (currently cleaner than the callback example)
